\usage{
pp_forward_search(
  fit_ref,
  path = NULL,
  num_steps = NULL,
  S = 30,
  S_eval = 100,
  base_model = c()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_ref}{The reference model fit.}

\item{path}{Pre-defined search path. If \code{NULL}, path is
not pre-defined.}

\item{num_steps}{Number of steps to run. If \code{NULL}, the search stops
when predictive performance of the submodel is close to that of reference
model.}

\item{S}{Number of draws to project when selecting next step.}

\item{S_eval}{Number of draws to project when evaluating step.}

\item{base_model}{Indices of terms that should be in the model already
in the beginning. These indices are same as the index of the term in
\code{fit_ref$get_model()$term_names()}.}
